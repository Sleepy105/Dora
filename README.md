# Rasbot

## What is it?
This is a small differential terrestrial robot with all the sensors one can fit.
Its purpose is to have all the sensors and interfaces one can imagine so it can be used for research in various topics as well as different competitions.

Since its goal is to be resourceful in terms of sensing and actuating capabilities the design has expandability in mind. Therefore, there are a lot of exposed pins for modular expansions to the robot.

### Getting Support
There is extensive documentation on the Wiki page here on GitHub that covers the robot's design (hardware and software) as well as how to use this robot.

If you are a user of this robot and something is not working on your side please help us improve it. Open an issue here on GitHub!

### Contributing

Even if you are not familiar with hardware or software you can simply create new issues suggesting new things or changes/fixes to the current design.

This project is configured with CADLAB.io so visual differences of changes can be analysed.
