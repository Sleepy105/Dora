# Rasbot

## What is it?
This is a small differential terrestrial robot with all the sensors one can fit.
Its purpose is to have all the sensors and interfaces one can imagine so it can be used for research in various topics as well as different competitions.

Since its goal is to be resourceful in terms of sensing and actuating capabilities the design has expandability in mind. So there is a lot of exposed pins for future additions to the robot.

### Getting Support
There is an extensive documentation on the Wiki page here on GitHub that covers the robot's design (hardware and software) as well has how to use this robot.

If you are a user of this robot and something is not working on your side please help us improve it. Fill an issue here on GitHub!

### Contributing
Be it hardware or software you can freely contribute to this project. Usually the Issues page here on GitHub has work that needs to be done. You are free to solve one yourself. Even if you are not familiar with hardware neither software you can simply create new issues suggesting new things or changes/fixes to the current design (hardware or software).

This project is configured with CADLAB.io so visual differences of changes can be analysed.
